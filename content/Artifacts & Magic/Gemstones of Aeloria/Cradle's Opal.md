**Description:**  
The Opal, known as the *Dreamer’s Veil*, is a gemstone of dreams and illusions, tied to the enigmatic god Somnara, Keeper of Dreams and Realities. This mystical orb allows its bearer to traverse the dreamscape, manipulate illusions, and bring fantasies to life. Legends say the Opal can blur the boundary between waking and sleeping, granting its wielder the power to shape reality itself. Coveted by dreamers and visionaries, it is as elusive as the dreams it governs.
