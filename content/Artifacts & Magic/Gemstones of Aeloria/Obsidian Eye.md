**Description:**  
The Obsidian Eye, known as *Shadow’s Whisper*, is a gemstone of darkness and shadow, tied to the secrets of Arachnathria, the City of Spiders hidden within the Phantom Crevice. This gem holds the power of knowledge and deceit, granting its bearer enhanced night vision, communication with arachnids, and the ability to weave potent illusions. Feared and revered, the Obsidian Eye is a tool of dominion, perfectly suited for the Spider Queen’s web of influence. Its power is as corrupting as it is potent, amplifying her reach and control over all who dare oppose her.
