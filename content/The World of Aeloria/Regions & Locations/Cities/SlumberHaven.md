### **1. The Warden's Keep**  
- **Description:** A sturdy stone building, once a defensive outpost for the region’s soldiers. Now, it houses the town’s leader, **Warden Harla**, who tries to keep order amidst the chaos brewing in SlumberHaven. The keep is guarded, but fewer soldiers remain, and cracks are beginning to show in the walls, symbolic of the growing unease in the town.

### **2. The Graveyard of Fallen Names**  
- **Description:** This small, overgrown cemetery is home to the graves of SlumberHaven’s past villagers. Most of the headstones are worn and illegible, but locals say strange whispers can sometimes be heard at night, carried on the mist from Thorned Lake. Villagers believe that the unrest of the dead is tied to the growing disturbances beneath the town.

### **3. The Shrine of the Forgotten Tide**  
- **Description:** An ancient shrine dedicated to the god **Mystersea**, the deity of the sea, dreams, and mystery. The shrine stands at the center of town, with carvings of waves and sea creatures adorning its walls. A faint, ethereal glow sometimes emanates from the shrine at night, leading some villagers to leave offerings in hopes of protection.

### **4. The Rusted Anchor Tavern**  
- **Description:** The largest and most lively establishment in SlumberHaven—at least, it used to be. The tavern now serves as a refuge for those too afraid to leave town. Inside, the atmosphere is heavy, with whispers of the strange happenings circulating among patrons. The tavern owner, **Garrick Foamracer**, listens closely to all the gossip, though he’s tight-lipped about his own opinions.

### **5. The Town Square**  
- **Description:** The center of SlumberHaven, where villagers once gathered for festivals and markets. Now, the square is a ghostly echo of its former self, with most stalls abandoned and boarded up. Occasionally, a lone merchant will appear, offering strange goods from faraway places, but the square is mostly silent, save for the wind and the occasional tremor.

### **6. The Old Apothecary**  
- **Description:** A crumbling stone building that used to be a place of healing. The apothecary’s shelves are mostly bare now, and the air inside smells of old herbs and decay. The current owner, **Elda Thistledown**, is an elderly herbalist who continues to mix poultices from whatever she can find, but she’s grown increasingly paranoid, claiming the plants themselves are wilting due to dark magic.

### **7. The Sleeping Gull Inn**  
- **Description:** This quaint, two-story inn is one of the few places in town still offering lodging to travelers. The innkeeper, **Madra Skelter**, is kind but visibly worried, as the number of guests has dwindled. Those who stay often report strange, fitful dreams that leave them more tired than rested.

### **8. The Fishmonger’s Wharf**  
- **Description:** This small pier is where local fishermen used to unload their catch, but the waters have grown dangerous, and few dare to fish anymore. The fishmonger's stalls are empty, and the pier creaks ominously, as though the lake is claiming it inch by inch. Some say they’ve seen ghostly figures standing on the pier at night, gazing out over the water.

### **9. The Blacksmith’s Forge**  
- **Description:** Run by **Jorin Ironfoot**, a grizzled old blacksmith who’s one of the few remaining craftsmen in town. His forge still burns hot, though his work is mostly in repairing tools and old weapons. He has noticed that the metal itself seems to be weakening, as if the earth’s disturbances are affecting even the materials beneath his hammer.

### **10. The Windmill of Lost Echoes**  
- **Description:** This once-proud windmill stands at the edge of town, now falling into disrepair. Its blades no longer turn, and locals say the wind here carries strange echoes, voices that seem to whisper forgotten names. Some believe the windmill is a focal point for the strange magic afflicting SlumberHaven, but no one dares go near it to investigate.

### **11. The Fisher’s Watchtower**  
- **Description:** Located on a small island just off the coast, the tower was once used by fishermen to keep watch over the lake. Now it stands abandoned, its windows dark and empty. Some say the tower’s height offers a view of the Rune Reservoir's true power, but no one who ventures there returns unchanged.

### **12. The Lighthouse of the Drowned**  
- **Description:** Perched on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the lake, this lighthouse was built to guide ships safely through the fog. It still functions, though the light flickers occasionally, and the air around it feels unnaturally cold. Many sailors who passed through here vanished under mysterious circumstances, and the locals believe the lighthouse is cursed by the spirits of the drowned.

### **13. The Crumbling Gate**  
- **Description:** The main entrance to SlumberHaven, this old wooden gate is barely standing, its hinges rusted and its beams cracked. It once served as a defensive barrier, but now it is mostly symbolic. The villagers rarely venture beyond the gate, especially with the strange happenings around town. The gatehouse is abandoned, though villagers sometimes claim to hear footsteps and whispers coming from within.
