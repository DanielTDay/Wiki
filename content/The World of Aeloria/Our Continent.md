# Drunstowr

## City in the Swamp.
A multitude of small islands scattered across a misty, boggy, black-water swamp.

The region is ripe with death, and is said to be a prison for old and forgotten gods chained and drowned in its diseased waters.

Ancient legends speak of this place being once fertile land upon which a great Tower stood. No remnants of such a place remain.

## Wherein the Dead Shall be Watched Over
In the stund zeed mountains

A small village in a remote valley famed for carrying their dead in great processions to a mountainous plateau.

It is there that, within a **Kapela** - a triangular stone construction resembling a cavernous mead hall topped with an enormous boulder - tradition dictates the dead be watched over by visiting warriors for three days and three nights before the spirit of the deceased embarks upon its final journey towards eternity.

The reward to those partaking in this ritual of Passing is rumoured to be great, for the Villagers are said to offer the weight of the dead's soul in coin and gem-stones; a reward known as the "Horn of Bouldersproke".
