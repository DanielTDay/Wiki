They are strong swimmers with webbed feet and often collect shells and trinkets to decorate their hair or beards. Sea dwarves are expert sailors and value a sturdy ship highly. Sea dwarves are expert tool makers and always try to carry tools for the occasion on them. They have a saying "He who dies with the most tools wins".
